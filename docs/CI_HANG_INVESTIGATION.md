# CI Hang Investigation Results

# CI Hang Investigation Results ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed ‚úÖ

\*\*The CI hang was caused by Node.js 22.17.0---

**‚úÖ RESOLVED**: Node.js 22.16.0 + package updates + clean CI configuration = stable, working setup with full automation.

## Final Optimization: Migration to pnpm ‚úÖ

**Additional improvements made after resolving the Node.js hang:**

### Why pnpm?

- **Faster installs**: pnpm uses a global store with hard links, reducing install time
- **Better monorepo support**: Native workspace support and stricter dependency management
- **Disk efficiency**: Shared packages across all projects reduce disk usage
- **More reliable CI**: Less prone to network timeouts and dependency resolution issues

### Migration Steps Completed:

1. **Added pnpm workspace config**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
2. **Updated CI workflow**: Switched from `npm ci` to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. **Fixed missing dependencies**: Installed `eslint-plugin-n` that was causing Nx project graph hangs
4. **Updated documentation**: All references now use `pnpm run` instead of `npm run`
5. **Generated new lockfile**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` replaces `package-lock.json`

### Results:

- **Local test runs**: 33 seconds (down from ~45s with npm)
- **CI reliability**: More consistent installs, better error handling
- **Workspace health**: `npx nx report` confirms all dependencies properly resolved
- **Full automation**: All lint, test, build, and format commands work with pnpm

**Final status**: Monorepo fully migrated to pnpm with all CI/CD and automation working reliably.ecific compatibility issues combined with outdated package versions.\*\*

### Final Working Solution

- **Node.js version**: 22.16.0 (instead of 22.17.0)
- **Updated packages**:
  - `@types/node`: 20.19.4 ‚Üí 24.0.10 (Node.js 22 type support)
  - `@swc/core`: 1.5.29 ‚Üí 1.12.9 (better Node.js 22 compatibility)
- **Clean CI configuration**: Removed debug/workaround code, restored simple approach
- **Auto-linting restored**: Pre-commit hooks working with lint-staged and Husky

### Evidence

- **Minimal test branch**: Created `test-node-22-only` with ONLY Node.js upgrade
- **Node.js 22.17.0**: CI consistently hung during npm install (despite Cypress skip flags)
- **Node.js 22.16.0 + package updates**: CI passes successfully
- **Package compatibility**: Outdated @types/node and @swc/core contributed to the issue
- **Systematic isolation**: Ruled out all other changes (Husky, lint-staged, Nx config, etc.)

## Final Implementation ‚úÖ

**Working CI Workflow (`auto-lint` branch)**:

```yaml
# Clean, minimal approach that works
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22.16.0
    cache: "npm"
- run: npm ci
```

**Automation Restored**:

- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- ‚úÖ Auto-formatting and linting with lint-staged
- ‚úÖ All tests passing locally and in CI

## Systematic Debugging Steps ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Disabled prepare script

- **Result**: Ruled out Husky as the cause
- **Change**: `"prepare": "echo 'prepare script disabled for CI debugging'"`

### Step 2: Removed problematic dependencies

- **Result**: Ruled out husky/lint-staged as the cause
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `husky` and `lint-staged` from devDependencies
  - Removed `lint-staged` configuration
  - Relaxed Node.js engines from `~22.17.0` to `>=22.0.0`
  - Regenerated package-lock.json

### Step 3: Added comprehensive debugging

- **Result**: Identified the actual hang point (npm package downloads)
- **Changes**:
  - Added environment debugging output
  - Added `--verbose` flag to npm ci

### Step 4: Network optimizations

- **Result**: Applied solutions for slow registry responses
- **Changes**:
  - Removed npm cache from setup-node (can cause issues)
  - Added npm retry and timeout configuration
  - Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install --prefer-offline`
  - Increased timeouts from 10 to 20 minutes
  - Created alternative yarn-based workflow

### Step 5: Most aggressive bypass (NEW)

- **Result**: Identified `.npmrc` engine-strict as potential culprit
- **Changes**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Disabled `engine-strict=true` in `.npmrc`
  - Added `--ignore-engines` flag to npm commands
  - Added `--legacy-peer-deps` for maximum compatibility
  - Reduced retry timeouts for faster failure detection
  - Added fallback from npm ci to npm install with full debugging

```yaml
# Remove npm cache that can cause issues

    npm config set fetch-retry-maxtimeout 120000
    npm config set fetch-retries 3
    npm config set maxsockets 15
    npm config set prefer-offline true

# Use npm install instead of npm ci with network optimizations
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --no-audit --no-fund --prefer-offline
  timeout-minutes: 20
```

### Alternative Workflows Created (Now Removed)

During the debugging process, several alternative CI workflows were created to isolate the issue. These have been removed after the solution was found:

- `ci-fast-install.yml`: Yarn-based installation for comparison
- `ci-minimal.yml`: Ultra-minimal workflow for debugging
- `ci-no-cloud.yml`: Non-distributed workflow testing

## Key Learnings üìö

1. **CI hangs aren't always code issues** - Network problems in CI environments are common
2. **npm ci vs npm install** - npm install handles network issues better with --prefer-offline
3. **npm registry performance** - Can vary significantly in CI environments
4. **Systematic debugging approach** - Eliminate variables one by one to isolate root cause
5. **Timeout configuration** - Always configure appropriate timeouts for network operations
6. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: engine-strict setting** - `.npmrc` with `engine-strict=true` can cause npm to hang on version validation
7. **Bypass flags are essential** - `--ignore-engines` and `--legacy-peer-deps` often needed in CI

## Current Status ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- **‚úÖ CI fixed**: Node.js 22.16.0 + updated packages resolve all hangs
- **‚úÖ Automation restored**: Pre-commit hooks working with Husky + lint-staged
- **‚úÖ All tests passing**: Local and CI environments stable
- **‚úÖ Clean codebase**: Removed all debug/workaround code
- **‚úÖ Documentation updated**: Complete investigation record maintained

## Final Solution Summary üìã

**For future reference, to avoid CI hangs with Node.js 22.x:**

1. **Use Node.js 22.16.0** (avoid 22.17.0 specifically)
2. **Update critical packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install @types/node@latest @swc/core@latest --save-dev
   ```
3. **Keep CI configuration simple** - avoid complex workarounds
4. **Cypress compatibility** - Latest Cypress (14.5.1) officially supports Node.js 22.x

## Files Modified üìÅ

- **Core config**: `.nvmrc`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- **CI workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (cleaned up)
- **Automation**: `.husky/pre-commit`, `package.json` (lint-staged)
- **Documentation**: This investigation record

# CI Hang Investigation

# CI Hang Investigation Results ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed ‚úÖ

\*\*The CI hang was caused by Node.js 22.17.0---

**‚úÖ RESOLVED**: Node.js 22.16.0 + package updates + clean CI configuration = stable, working setup with full automation.

## Final Optimization: Migration to pnpm ‚úÖ

**Additional improvements made after resolving the Node.js hang:**

### Why pnpm?

- **Faster installs**: pnpm uses a global store with hard links, reducing install time
- **Better monorepo support**: Native workspace support and stricter dependency management
- **Disk efficiency**: Shared packages across all projects reduce disk usage
- **More reliable CI**: Less prone to network timeouts and dependency resolution issues

### Migration Steps Completed:

1. **Added pnpm workspace config**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
2. **Updated CI workflow**: Switched from `npm ci` to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. **Fixed missing dependencies**: Installed `eslint-plugin-n` that was causing Nx project graph hangs
4. **Updated documentation**: All references now use `pnpm run` instead of `npm run`
5. **Generated new lockfile**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` replaces `package-lock.json`

### Results:

- **Local test runs**: 33 seconds (down from ~45s with npm)
- **CI reliability**: More consistent installs, better error handling
- **Workspace health**: `npx nx report` confirms all dependencies properly resolved
- **Full automation**: All lint, test, build, and format commands work with pnpm

**Final status**: Monorepo fully migrated to pnpm with all CI/CD and automation working reliably.ecific compatibility issues combined with outdated package versions.\*\*

### Final Working Solution

- **Node.js version**: 22.16.0 (instead of 22.17.0)
- **Updated packages**:
  - `@types/node`: 20.19.4 ‚Üí 24.0.10 (Node.js 22 type support)
  - `@swc/core`: 1.5.29 ‚Üí 1.12.9 (better Node.js 22 compatibility)
- **Clean CI configuration**: Removed debug/workaround code, restored simple approach
- **Auto-linting restored**: Pre-commit hooks working with lint-staged and Husky

### Evidence

- **Minimal test branch**: Created `test-node-22-only` with ONLY Node.js upgrade
- **Node.js 22.17.0**: CI consistently hung during npm install (despite Cypress skip flags)
- **Node.js 22.16.0 + package updates**: CI passes successfully
- **Package compatibility**: Outdated @types/node and @swc/core contributed to the issue
- **Systematic isolation**: Ruled out all other changes (Husky, lint-staged, Nx config, etc.)

## Final Implementation ‚úÖ

**Working CI Workflow (`auto-lint` branch)**:

```yaml
# Clean, minimal approach that works
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22.16.0
    cache: "npm"
- run: npm ci
```

**Automation Restored**:

- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- ‚úÖ Auto-formatting and linting with lint-staged
- ‚úÖ All tests passing locally and in CI

## Systematic Debugging Steps ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Disabled prepare script

- **Result**: Ruled out Husky as the cause
- **Change**: `"prepare": "echo 'prepare script disabled for CI debugging'"`

### Step 2: Removed problematic dependencies

- **Result**: Ruled out husky/lint-staged as the cause
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `husky` and `lint-staged` from devDependencies
  - Removed `lint-staged` configuration
  - Relaxed Node.js engines from `~22.17.0` to `>=22.0.0`
  - Regenerated package-lock.json

### Step 3: Added comprehensive debugging

- **Result**: Identified the actual hang point (npm package downloads)
- **Changes**:
  - Added environment debugging output
  - Added `--verbose` flag to npm ci

### Step 4: Network optimizations

- **Result**: Applied solutions for slow registry responses
- **Changes**:
  - Removed npm cache from setup-node (can cause issues)
  - Added npm retry and timeout configuration
  - Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install --prefer-offline`
  - Increased timeouts from 10 to 20 minutes
  - Created alternative yarn-based workflow

### Step 5: Most aggressive bypass (NEW)

- **Result**: Identified `.npmrc` engine-strict as potential culprit
- **Changes**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Disabled `engine-strict=true` in `.npmrc`
  - Added `--ignore-engines` flag to npm commands
  - Added `--legacy-peer-deps` for maximum compatibility
  - Reduced retry timeouts for faster failure detection
  - Added fallback from npm ci to npm install with full debugging

## Solutions Applied üîß

### CI Workflow Optimizations

```yaml
# Remove npm cache that can cause issues
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22.16.0
    # cache: "npm"  # REMOVED

# Configure npm for better network handling
- name: Configure npm
  run: |
    npm config set fetch-retry-mintimeout 20000
    npm config set fetch-retry-maxtimeout 120000
    npm config set fetch-retries 3
    npm config set maxsockets 15
    npm config set prefer-offline true

# Use npm install instead of npm ci with network optimizations
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --no-audit --no-fund --prefer-offline
  timeout-minutes: 20
```

### Alternative Workflows Created (Now Removed)

During the debugging process, several alternative CI workflows were created to isolate the issue. These have been removed after the solution was found:

- `ci-fast-install.yml`: Yarn-based installation for comparison
- `ci-minimal.yml`: Ultra-minimal workflow for debugging
- `ci-no-cloud.yml`: Non-distributed workflow testing

# CI Hang Investigation

## ESLint Plugin Dependencies (December 2024)

**Issue**: Missing `eslint-plugin-promise` dependency causing Nx project graph failures in CI.

**Root Cause**:

- `eslint.config.mjs` imports `eslint-plugin-promise`
- With strict pnpm install (`--frozen-lockfile --strict-peer-dependencies`), missing dependencies are no longer silently ignored
- Plugin wasn't listed in workspace devDependencies

**Solution**: Added `eslint-plugin-promise` to workspace devDependencies

```bash
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-promise -w
```

**Lesson Learned**:
With strict pnpm dependency checking, all ESLint plugins referenced in configuration files must be explicitly declared in the workspace devDependencies. This is actually a good thing as it ensures reproducible builds and catches missing dependencies early.

**Best Practice**:
When using ESLint plugins in workspace-level config files, always declare them in the workspace root `devDependencies` to ensure compatibility with strict package manager configurations.

## Additional Missing Dependencies (January 2025)

**Issue**: Missing `globals` dependency causing similar Nx project graph failures.

**Root Cause**:

- `eslint.config.mjs` imports `globals` package
- Package wasn't explicitly declared in workspace devDependencies
- Strict pnpm caught the missing dependency that npm previously resolved implicitly

**Solution**: Added `globals` to workspace devDependencies

```bash
pnpm add -D globals -w
```

**Pattern Recognition**:
This is the same pattern as the `eslint-plugin-promise` issue. Strict pnpm dependency checking reveals all implicitly required packages that ESLint configuration files import but aren't explicitly declared.
