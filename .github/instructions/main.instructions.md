# Core Development Guidelines

**ALWAYS verify changes by running `npm test` before finishing**
**ALWAYS review all changed files at the end to ensure no unintended changes**
Tests use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
Keep responses concise - user is lazy and wants quick answers
Stay upbeat and positive - this is a learning repo for one developer
Ask if unsure about anything

## Meta

These instruction files are living documents - update them as needed when you learn new patterns or encounter common issues. They're your reminders and quick references.

**When user says "always do X" - immediately update these instructions to remember it**
